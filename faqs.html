                         The charging session will depend on several factors including:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>The battery level or, your "State of Charge"</strong> Batteries charge fastest when they are nearly empty (low SOC) </li>
                            <li><strong>The duration of your fast charge</strong> As the battery fills up, the charging rate slows down to maximize the battery life. Above 80% SOC, it might be better to switch to an AC Level 2 charger.</li>
                            <li><strong>The battery temperature</strong> Batteries don't like to be too hot or too cold. During extreme weather (hot or cold), your charging rate will be slower.</li>
                            <li><strong>Battery deterioration</strong> Batteries can deteriorate over time and lose capacity. The normal loss of a battery's capacity is defined by the vehicle's warranty.</li>
                            <li><strong>Your vehicle's current and voltage limits.</strong> Imagine electricity as water flowing through a pipe. The amount of power (kW) you receive is the product of Voltage (V) and Current (A). Both your vehicle and the charger have voltage and current limits.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            When you plugin (let’s say to a 50kW charger), the charger matches your EV battery voltage and delivers current. This current is limited by either the charger or the vehicle (whichever is lower). If your EV battery has a voltage limit below 400V (let’s say 220V), the charger may deliver less than the maximum power available because the charger reached the maximum current limit (of 125A).

                        First ensure that the charging is stopped. If it is still not disconnected try the following tips.
						 <ul>
                            <li>The car should release the connector automatically, you can use the key to lock and unlock the doors, this will release the socket.</li>
                            <li>Sometime the connector stuck due to the weight of the cable, try supporting the cable and then unlock the connector using car keys.</li>

                         The charging session will depend on several factors including:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>The battery level or, your "State of Charge"</strong> Batteries charge fastest when they are nearly empty (low SOC) </li>
                            <li><strong>The duration of your fast charge</strong> As the battery fills up, the charging rate slows down to maximize the battery life. Above 80% SOC, it might be better to switch to an AC Level 2 charger.</li>
                            <li><strong>The battery temperature</strong> Batteries don't like to be too hot or too cold. During extreme weather (hot or cold), your charging rate will be slower.</li>
                            <li><strong>Battery deterioration</strong> Batteries can deteriorate over time and lose capacity. The normal loss of a battery's capacity is defined by the vehicle's warranty.</li>
                            <li><strong>Your vehicle's current and voltage limits.</strong> Imagine electricity as water flowing through a pipe. The amount of power (kW) you receive is the product of Voltage (V) and Current (A). Both your vehicle and the charger have voltage and current limits.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            When you plugin (let’s say to a 50kW charger), the charger matches your EV battery voltage and delivers current. This current is limited by either the charger or the vehicle (whichever is lower). If your EV battery has a voltage limit below 400V (let’s say 220V), the charger may deliver less than the maximum power available because the charger reached the maximum current limit (of 125A).

                        First ensure that the charging is stopped. If it is still not disconnected try the following tips.
						 <ul>
                            <li>The car should release the connector automatically, you can use the key to lock and unlock the doors, this will release the socket.</li>
                            <li>Sometime the connector stuck due to the weight of the cable, try supporting the cable and then unlock the connector using car keys.</li>
